We worked on the first project: 'Digitize Handwritten Exams from Students'.
This repository contains python notebook for a fine-tuned TrOCR model which can detect german text from images of german text. 
It also contains our proposal regarding the same topic, which states what steps we have taken to complete this task, as well as our future goals for a complete system, that can actually digitize the handwritten exams from students, and ease the workload of the tutor.
